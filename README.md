# Number-Guessing-game
-The goal of this project is to create a simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a random number within a chosen range. 
-The game includes different difficulty like easy, medium and hard levels limiting the number of guesses based on how hard the player wants the game to be.
-It also gives feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and lets the player decide if they want to play again.
